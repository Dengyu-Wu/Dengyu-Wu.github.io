I am a PhD candidate (2019 - present) in Computer Science at <a class="page-link" href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/"> University of Liverpool </a> supervised by  <a class="page-link" href="https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/"> Prof Xiaowei Huang</a> and  <a class="page-link" href="https://sites.google.com/site/xinpingyi00/"> Dr Xinping Yi</a>. My reseach topic is Spiking Neural Network (SNN) in response to the high demand for low-power applications of artificial intelligence system.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained MSc degree in Microelectronics at the University of Liverpool and had two-year indutrial experience on IC design, especially on digital system design and verification.
