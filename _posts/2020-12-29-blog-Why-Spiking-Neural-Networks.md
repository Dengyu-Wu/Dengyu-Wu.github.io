<div class="par_20">    
<p>Spiking neural network (SNN), the third-generation neural network, imitates the behaviour of biogical neural network to prcoess and forward information. SNN research involves neuroscience, microelectronic systems and computer science to undersand human brain and replicate its processing. Although AlphaGo [1] as the first computer program defeated a professional human Go player, it contains thousands of CPUs and hundreds of GPUs to maintain its functions, taking more than 1,000,000W of electricity, while the human brain integrated with hundreds of billions of neurons only needs 20W of power [2]. Combined with neuromorphic hardware, such as TrueNorth [3], Loihi [4] and Tianji [5], spiking-based computing systems can signifantly reduce power consumption of recognition tasks by using less operations and energy-efficient synatic operation [6].</p></div>

<div class="par_20">    
<p>In general, SNN can be helpful to explore more application areas (such as edge computing), for its clear advantage over tradition artificial neural network in terms of its energy efficiency and event-driven nature.</p></div>
